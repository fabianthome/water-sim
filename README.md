# How to Use
* After cloning the project, open it in Godot (4.6) and run the scene called "basic".
* Cycle through various wave shaders using `1`-`4` with the following assignments:
  1. Sine
  2. Gerstner
  3. Sum of Gerstner
  4. Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM)
* Move the camera using `W`/`A`/`S`/`D`. Move up and down using `E`/`Q`. Rotate the camera by pressing `RMB` and moving the mouse.
* Increase/decrease shader sizes using `+`/`-`, respectively. Reset sizes using `#`.
* When displaying the Sine wave, use `b` to spawn a barrel with buoyancy.
* When displaying the FBM wave, use `h` to spawn multiple fields, simulating an entire ocean.
